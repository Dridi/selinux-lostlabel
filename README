SELinux "lost label" inconsistency
==================================

To try it out:

    $ make
    $ sudo dnf install noarch/lostlabel-0.1-1.noarch.rpm

Check that the policy was properly installed:

    $ sudo semanage fcontext -l | grep lostlabel

Finally, create a file inside nested directories:

    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/lostlabel/foo/bar
    $ sudo touch /var/lib/lostlabel/foo/bar/baz
    $ sudo restorecon -rv /var/lib/lostlabel

This will show that everything was labeled lostlabel_var_lib_t and then
"restored" to the more granular types. Since everything under lostlabel
was just created, they never had the correct labels in the first place.

To clean it up:

    $ sudo dnf remove lostlabel

It should remove everything cleanly from the system, hopefully.
